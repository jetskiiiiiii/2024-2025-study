Love is a gentle, tender flame
That lights up the darkness of our souls
It heals our wounds and eases our pain
Guiding us towards our ultimate goals

It lifts us up when we are down
And gives us strength to carry on
Love's sweet embrace can turn a frown
Into a smile that shines like the dawn

In love we find our truest selves
Our deepest fears and desires revealed
It's a journey of highs and lows
But with love, every wound can be healed

So cherish the love that you hold dear
It's a precious gift to be treasured
Let it fill your heart with joy and cheer
For love is a feeling truly unparalleled.
